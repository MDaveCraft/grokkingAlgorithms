## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures. By studying these implementations, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how these data structures work and how to effectively use them in their own projects.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented in this project:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table
- Binary Tree
- Heap
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented in multiple programming languages, allowing developers to compare and contrast different approaches and syntax.
